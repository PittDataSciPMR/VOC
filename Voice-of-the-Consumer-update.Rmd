**Aim 3: Data synthesis, extrapolation, analysis and modeling:**  



**Questions:**  
**What are the current transportation practices of individuals with disabilities?**  

  - What are the **primary modes of transportation** (i.e. fixed route public bus, shared, personal vehicle-passenger, personal vehicle-driver, Rideshare app (Uber or Lyft), automated vehicles, etc.)?  

  - What are the **usage rates** for each mode of transportation?  

**What are the current perceptions (e.g. barriers/facilitators) of individuals with disabilities regarding accessibility of each mode of transportation?**  

  - How often to people experience barriers with getting to where they need to go in the community for these modes of transportation?
  If the traveler with a disability is a parent, child, sibling, or spouse, how does that role affect accessible travel? If the travel companion of the person with a disability is a parent, child, sibling, spouses or relative how does that role affect accessible travel?
  
  - How much do barriers with current modes of transportation and transportation related services (e.g. access to adaptive driving training programs, vehicle modifications, paratransit, ride share) affect access to accessible transportation?


**How much do barriers with transportation and transportation related services (e.g. access to adaptive driving training programs, vehicle modifications, paratransit, ride share) impact community participation?** 


  - How frequently do barriers with transportation and related services impact community participation for essential (e.g. medical, work, school, grocery etc.) and less essential (e.g. social and recreational events, etc.) activities and locations
ASPIRE Center  

  - What are the primary reasons for these problems (e.g. too costly, scheduling inconveniences, unreliable, unsafe, requires specialized equipment/adaptations, unable to accommodate additional travelers (spouse, child, service animal, attendant)  
  
  - What are the anticipated barriers/facilitators to using automated vehicles for transportation?  
  
  - What vehicle features or services would be needed to make automated vehicles accessible?  
  
  - What potential impact (influence) could accessible automated vehicles have on community participation?  
  
  
  
Others

Are there any floor/ceiling effects? If so, do the questions need to be modified?  
What is the consensus on AV/ATS amongst disability groups?  
Is there a disparity across geographical locations?  
Are there differing viewpoints across disability groups?  
What areas of autonomous vehicle development should be a priority (e.g. wheelchair securement)?

## Caregivers of persons with disability    


----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Issues:

1. For questions "Please choose the answer which best describes you for survey
purposes." - you can only select one choice of   
 - Person with a disability  
 - Partner/Caregiver of person(s) with a disability  
 - Older Adult (65+)  
 
If a participant has all 3 roles, they will have to repeat the survey 3ce.  
This potentially introduces bias as the responses they provide at each of these instances might be different.  

They may give a question more or less thought when re-answering them.  
This could affect the internal validity of the results since responses from people who took the survey multiple times are not exactly comparable to those who took only once.  

Suggested solution: Ability to select more than one role.  



2. Related to Issue 1, dpct sums up to 585. the question is only asked if conset==yes  which isnt in all cases  

 



```{r}

#END


```



# Next Steps  

1. Chi-sq/Fischer exact for demographic characteristics
2. Cochran Q test for multiple response questions. 
3. Hierarchical Clustering to identify characteristics associated with certain responses 
4. Multinomial logistics regression to test the effects of the identified characteristics dimension reduction


## Modeling.

A1. Feature selection using Principal Component Analysis  
2. Identify latent structures related to geography  

3a. Evaluate features based on Eigenvalues and factor matrix (retain those >1)  

3b. Evaluate features with permutation tests to test significance

B. Neural network node with RBF to identify dimensionality of the variables.  

C. XGBoost 

5. Perform Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) for each model  


6. Cluster analysis using KMC




```{r}

#transport modes cochran Q test
dataf_tx<-dataf[,c(1,14:20)]
for (i in 1:nrow(dataf_tx)){
  for (j in 1:ncol(dataf_tx)){
      if (dataf_tx[i,j]=="Checked"){dataf_tx[i,j]<-"1"}
    if (dataf_tx[i,j]=="Unchecked"){dataf_tx[i,j]<-"0"}
  }
}
